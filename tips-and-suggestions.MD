Tip #1: Ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions.
        Before starting on your implementation, be clear on the requirements.
        Describe your high level approach first before implementing.
        Don't over-complicate your algorithm to fit in specific concepts - we are looking for answers to the question, not looking for certain techniques.

Tip #2: Talk as you think!
        Verbalize your thoughts and logic while you’re solving a problem.
        Our interviewer wants to understand your thought process and how you go about solving a problem.
        By thinking out loud, you’ll give them an idea of your approach and they’ll be able to give you hints to steer you in the right direction.

Tip #3: You will be assessed on both speed as well as quality of the solution.
        Don’t take too much time to think through the problem, but take enough time that you can provide a clean and elegant solution.
        For some questions, the expectation is that someone should be able to work through the problem in “X” minutes.

Tip #4: If asked about an interesting project, choose a project that you are actually interested in.
        Show a deep understanding of the things you’re working on and give detailed information about your contribution to the project.

Tip #5: Find and fix your bugs using edge cases, tests, or other means.

Tip #7: Ask relevant and appropriate questions about LinkedIn to show your interest.
        This is your chance to interview us as well-- to make sure that LinkedIn is the right fit for you.
